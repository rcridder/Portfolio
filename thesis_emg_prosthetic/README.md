# Rose Ridder Sprint 2020 Senior Engineering Thesis

##Closing the Loop - Haptic Feedback for EMG-Controlled Prosthetics


This project investigates the design and development of a prosthetic hand controlled using Electromyogram (EMG) signals of the forearm with haptic feedback from sensors on the prosthetic limb. As part of Rose Ridderâ€™s Culminating Exercise in Engineering, Ridder designed this system to connect control and feedback mechanisms and integrate four years of engineering study at Swarthmore College. In this project, a simple EMG-controled, 3D printed prosthetic that provides fingertip pressure-based feedback to the user is prototyped with a material cost of less than $100.

Please review the included Thesis report pdf. Associated code is attached, with main.c intended to operate an MSP430, and EMGDetector2Sensors.ino operating an Arduino circuit playground. Circuit diagrams are included for assembly.
