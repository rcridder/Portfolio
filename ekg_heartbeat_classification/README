Instructions on how to run the code:

- Save the csv data files from https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat#mitbih_test.csv
titled mitbih_test and mitbih_train.

- We set up variables called scratchfilepath, train_filename, and test_filename on lines 13-15.
This allowed us to access the data by writing scratchfilepath+train_filename, and test
the network using data from scratchfilepath+test_filename.
Lines 13-15 must be updated to include the paths you have used in downloading.
The important thing here is that the correct path to the data set is given when
creating the test_data and train_data.

- Make sure that the machine contains all of the software packages needed to use Keras.
Machines with GPU's are ideal.

- To create a network you can use the following command line
python3 heartbeat_network.py
This will save a model with the name "StandardModel_50_epochs.h5". You can change the
name of the model if desired by typing another name as an additional command line argument.

- To create a confusion matrix of a model you can use the following command line
python3 evaluateModel.py <name_of_your_model.h5>

- The file plotbeats.py was used to assist us in the creation of visual materials
for our presentation. There should be no need to run this file.

- All other files are .h5(models), .png(images), or .csv(data).
