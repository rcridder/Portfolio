# A model of Covid (or any infectious disease) spread built in April of 2020

This model is based on the SIRS mathematical model, an epidemiological model that represents a population within one of three categories: "susceptible", "infected", and "removed". This model is extended to categorize "removed" as temporarily immune, and also adds another variable, D, for a group permanently immune or removed entirely from the population.

This report was generated experimentally using varying R0 values, or the basic reproduction rate (i.e. contagion level) based on ranges calculated from early experiments during the Covid-19 pandemic.
